## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
javascript.info: generic javascript syntax
w3Schools: generic javascript, html, css syntax

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
At first when I was typing some of the index.html code I was getting some error life if it was not written correctly ( the red line at the bottom of the words).
At first I didn't understand why I was getting the error, especially because I was using all the right syntax such as opening and closing all the <>, and everything was spelled correctly. 
So I decided to look over all the code, at first it wasnâ€™t as obvious to me but the error was that classes were too close together and a space was needed. After I fixed that problem I decided to read more about CSS in w3schools so I wouldn't make another small mistake like that later. 
Also the first time I preview my project, one of the boxes were not lighting on and the win box was not showing up so I go take a look at my logic behind the flowchart and noticed that it was a mistake in my if else code so I fixed the error so now one of the if functions takes the me to the code of the winning box popping up.
I fixed the color of the box by just removing some of the extra brackets that were in the css file. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
When I finished this project I realized that the project has so much room for improvement . For example, how can I get my website to also work on my phone? What other applications or ways can I use to make a website more interactive. 
For example, how can I improve my design so in this case of this memory game I can also have a menu that pops up, and the menu options take me to different pages of the game. Also how can I launch this website so it is available to everyone with an internet search.
Are there ways to store the data that is input into a website. How can I turn this application into a larger and more scalable project?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few hours into this project I would definitely speed up the game after each trial, add a scorebar so after every full attempt the player will get a point, add an option for a leaderboard, I would try the sounds to recreate famous songs. For example piano songs that can perfectly be recreated with sound of the game. 
I will change the background so it is not just a solid color. In my second attempt doing this project I will like to make sure that after every attempt it's a different pattern. I will also add a feature that allows you to choose out of three levels. For example in level 1 you get four squares , in level 2 you get 6 squares and in level 3 you get 10 squares and fast sounds.
